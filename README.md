# Everest: The Faux Base Camp Coding Academy Chatbot 

## Overview 
Everest is a non-machine learning chatbot created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Doing this project helped solidify our knowledge with HTML DOM Manipulation, as well as working with substrings and the setTimeout function. Along with that, we've also grown to view our projects in a more user friendly approach, due to the need of predicting inputs for the bot's responses.
